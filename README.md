## Installation

You'll find the latest releases on the [releases](https://github.com/CityChainFoundation/city-hub/releases) tab. Make sure you pick the latest release.

### Auto Updates

City Hub have built in support for updates. They are not installed automatically, but you as
a user are in control. On each startup, City Hub will check for a new version. Additionally if
you have been running City Hub for a long time, you can perform a manual update check in the menu.

When an update is available, there will appear an icon on the menu. Click this icon, to see
update information and perform a download and installation.

### Windows

For Windows, we decided to only support 64-bit installations of Windows. If you are running
a 32-bit installation, please let us know by reporting an issue to survey the market demand.

Simply download the latest win-x64.exe file from the [releases](https://github.com/CityChainFoundation/city-hub/releases) page and run
the installer. You might need to approve installation of unsigned installer. This will only
be required until we have a signed release available.

### Linux

For Linux, we decided to use the new AppImage installer format. This is included in a lot of
Linux distributions, including Ubuntu.

Download the latest linux-x86_64.AppImage from the [releases](https://github.com/CityChainFoundation/city-hub/releases) page.

Open a terminal, navigate to the download folder and make the .AppImage an executeable with 
the following command:

```
$ chmod a+x City.*.AppImage
```

Then you can simply run the installer:

```
$ ./City.*.AppImage
```

### Mac
