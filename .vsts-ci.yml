# City Hub - Continuous Integration Setup - VSTS

# It is important that the initial Agent Queue on VSTS is configured to be "Hosted Linux Preview", and not "Hosted VS2017".
# If this is not configured correctly, builds will fail with error: 
# "Could not find a queue with name Hosted macOS Preview. The queue does not exist or has not been authorized for use."
