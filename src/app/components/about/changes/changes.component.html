            <strong>Auto-account selection on login screen.</strong> If no previous account has been used, the first is selected.
            This makes it more obvious what the user should do, after they have created or restored an account. It also reduces
            user tasks by one.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Auto-network selection on setup screen.</strong> During the preview release testing, only TESTNET and FULL MODE
            is supported, so these values are auto-selected on the initial setup screen. When the MAINNET is released, the
            setup screen will be skipped and the two options will be picked by default.</li>
